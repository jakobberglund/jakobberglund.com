I am working on a design system for a client. Most of the applications are built using Angular, but not all of them. As is the case in any large organization, there are a number of different stacks running, old and new. So we are moving the components from Angular to web components. Enter [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/), the not-a-framework for building web components.

Some first impressions:
- It's really easy to get started with. You can be up and running with a component library project in no-time.
- The automated project documentation is amazing! Seriously, it is so good.
- It feels so well thought out. It's all in the details, and the details are super-polished.
- I'd like an easier way of sharing functionality between components. Something like Angular's directives, React hooks, Vue's Composition API (or even mixins). Just.. something. But I guess it's what you get with class based components. Or maybe I'm just missing something.

I haven't had this good a first impression about a tool in a while. It does a pretty specific thing, but it does it really well.
